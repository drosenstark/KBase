      <Text>This is an almost final beta for the 3.0 release. In response to user requests and internal decisions, new features include:
- Search by date has been added.
- A modified date has been added to TheKBase files. Modified date is initially set to creation date of snippets that do not have one.
- A Snippet Info pane has been added to view and edit Snippet information. Right-click Info for any snippet.
- Plug-In API (still in development) so most of the new features are in the plugins directory. Currently plug-ins load under the Tools menu.
- Plug-In: Multi-language spell-checking for TextPane contents (thanks to Loresoft's NetSpell).
- Plug-In: Image viewer for Snippets.
- Files of any type may now be dragged into the TextPane (same as Insert Link To File).
- Files are saved with better security -- a backup file is made during each save operation.
- Now you can sort by date, name, and icon (right click on any Snippet to sort its children).
- PropertySets is a completely new feature. You can now aggregate properties in an enclosing (parent) snippet. This gets added as a new property pane.
- Search fields are no longer limited to three.
- Several bug fixes including forwards-compatability support in TheKBase files.

- Due to user requests, the license for TheKBase Desktop has changed to the GNU GPL. The code is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/thekbase/ and http://code.google.com/p/thekbase/
- UI for encrypted files has been changed to require the user's password if TheKBase is minimized. Also, for password-encrypted files, they are minimized after a 5-minute delay (non-configurable).
- Includes several small bug fixes (thanks to our users for reporting bugs!).</Text>

      <Text>- TheKBase logs to a file (thekbase.log) now if you turn tracing to true in the kbase.config. To watch the file, try mtail (http://ophilipp.free.fr/op_tail.htm)
- Last five files showing on File menu.
- You can now password protect Kbases. The technical details:
	- TheKBase uses Xml Encryption as specified by http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/
		Encryption uses the Rijndael algorithm (i.e., AES) with a 128-bit key (and block) size. As of 2003, the US Government considers this key-size correct for "Secret" but not "Top Secret" information (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).
	- HOWEVER, the key is based on the supplied password (it's a direct MD5 hash). For this reason, you should make your password as long and unpreditable as possible.</Text>

      <Text>- Parent Pane is now clickable.

Several improvements that increase the utility of the properties and search panes:
- You can now TYPE new values into the properties pane: TheKBase will prompt you as to whether to create the new nodes.
- Searches may be repeated by right clicking on the search snippet (usually starts with "Search for...").
- Right-click menu now shows only available options (almost).
- Searches now show enums correctly (e.g., Parent_Or_Own is now "Parent or Own").  
- Searches on ID are now allowed, and the search results text also shows the title.
- "Select Snippet" link now shows for Searches, allowing users to choose the Snippet whose ID they want to use in the Search (using the same interface as links between snippets).
- Bug fixed: Cursor was not returning correctly after the creation of snippet links. 
	
Two changes resulted in changes to the file format. .kbase files are fully backward and forward compatible, however:
- File format has been modified: searches are now saved (a child of Snippet is created with the name 'Criterion' for each search condition).
- File format has been modified: properties displayed in the properties pane are now automatically saved and loaded.

- Tracing now prints version information (turn on trace in the kbase.config, and use View --&gt; Show Tracing Information). NOTE: Turning on tracing in the kbase.config can affect performance.

    <Snippet>
      <Text>Includes several small bug fixes.  Also:
- Snippets that have several property values were not showing correctly in the Property Pane (error message was shown).  For instance, if a Snippet such as Color was shown in the properties pane, a selected snippet could not be classified under, for instance, red AND blue. This has been fixed to show *** Multiple Values *** and to handle the selection of *** NONE *** or one of the values.
- Massive snippet insert into the top-level was not working.  This has been fixed.
- SnippetIDs were not reseting on file new.   This has been fixed.
- Moving with alt-shift-up and down was not resetting the focus correctly.  This has been fixed.
