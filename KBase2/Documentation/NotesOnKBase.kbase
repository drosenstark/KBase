There are a few different issues here.  First is the SnippetPane and second is the Snippets.

SNIPPETPANE
- Right now the user makes a change to a SnippetTNode, which is attached to the SnippetPane via it's Nodes property.
- The refactor is quite different:
	- Introduce a SnippetNode object, which is really a model object.  It can return its children, for instance, or get its parents (is that necessary?  if so, do it).  This should obviously be an IFC so as maintain distribuibility.
	- The user does NOT make changes to the SnippetTNodes.  Instead, the user makes changes (or tries to make changes) to the SnippetNode object to which each SnippetTNode is linked.
	- Changes in the SnippetNode fire events on the corresponding SnippetTNode.
	- But where are the SnippetNodes housed?  Though I guess they are linked to the SnippetTNodes so really the Nodes should be sufficient to get you there, but some kind of way to traverse the tree or at least find children and so forth should be doable.  Some kind of dictionary.
- So what are the ns for this
	- Well we have one called SnippetTreeView, so this should be 
	- SnippetStructure
	- I wonder if we can just have one that handles both the snippets and their structure?  Like Model.  And then have the current implementation where it is currently?
	
SNIPPET
- Right now all the Snippets are loaded into memory and the SnippetDictionary is as well.  The SnippetDictionary merely needs to become an IFC so as to be able to load Snippets at will.</Text>

2) it would be nice to incorporate the action of automatically expanding a snippet when the cursor hovers on it for 2 sec or smthg like that

DR: have to look at this in File Explorer, how does it work?

1) if you cut a snippet you can apparently paste it only once...

2) hmmm. now this is really confusing... I tried to delete a snippet... 
there was a warning that it would permanently remove it... but it had a few clones in other locations. I tried since with dozens of snippets and the message always pops-up even if all of them have several clones. 
With some other snippets this does not happen, i.e. they are deleted without a warning since they have clones...

2005-04-25 18:08 PM
this is hard to replicate, must look at it in the code.

1) other locations (Property pane) are listed by the order of adding them--I think. It may be better to list them either alphabetically or by the order they appear in the Categories Pane... I am not sure about this point

7) compared to the rest, this is really a minor issue, but if you select a bunch of snippets, and then "cut" them, you may want them to go dimmed or smthg...

5) select a snippet that already belongs to a drop-down box category, assign it to another drop-down box category, it moves there, but the location pane goes grey??
DR: Correct, this only happens if you are working on the actual snippet LOCATED UNDER THE CATEGORY.  If you're doing this, why not just move it your damn self?

6) also, those snippets that are moved elsewhere, stay selected (open book
icon) and highlighted permanently (you
need to click on them to change that), although they are not really selected... in terms of operations
DR: This is another problem when you are working with the snippets that are under the category itself.

2005-04-27 01:02 AM
Okay, this is looking pretty good.  Should ensure that the snippets are visible in their new locations, I think.</Text>

4) multiple selection (again) does not work properly with drop-down boxes. I selected a bunch of snippets, then tried to assign them to a category from the drop-down box, and it would assign only one at the time, while still keeping all of them highlighted.
DR: The problem is more complex than this.  It doesn't work only if they already have different categories assigned.

2) when you try to paste a snippet into a location where it already exists, the pop-up message says illegal move. You should consider a message "this snippet already exists" or smthg like that. Especially since, if you're copying a bunch of snippets, only a few of them may be duplicates...

1) copy a snippet, paste it in a (couple of) new location(s), and the location window will show and count all those clones selected as separate snippets ("multiple snippets selected...")

3) have all sub-snippets of a snippet selected, let's say you have 5 snippets selected, now paste another snippet into that parent snippet, it is also added to the selection, so now you have 6 snippets selected

2005-04-27 17:24 PM

&gt;b) if you try to drag a snippet to its parent snippet it gives you an 
&gt;"illegal move" message. But, then, this is the only way to re-order 
&gt;snippets...

Yes that's been noted, he he.  I think I'm going to just add two things to the right click menu for Move Up and Move Down.  That's way cooler anyway, right?  If the snippets are not children of the same parent it will error.  feature request.

&gt;c) after you paste some text into a snippet (content pane), then move to 
&gt;another snippet and try to paste the same text, gives you an error

This happens if the text is coming from a NON-text source (if it's from Notepad, for instance, this doesn't happen).  Okay, I'll fix this BUG when I can.

If you rename it as expected, it edits it, but in fact it should force an Edit as soon as you create the snippet.  It already has a snippet name and everything.

If you click on a snippet and then edit it in the detail pane, then click on that same snippet and try to create a child, it does create it but gives you an Illegal Move error.  What up?

Note: it's a move that it's trying to do.

Man the new thing is so fucked up I don't know where to start.
- Renaming on double click no longer works
- On new, it selects but then it unselects
- The original code sucked anyway, because it doesn't "lessen" the selection at all

2005-04-14 12:51 PM

Another problem is that when you save it loses the cursor on the detail pane, so you have to get it to focus on the detail pane or there's no program.

2005-04-12 10:07 AM

Okay, so I'm trying to get some of the Bugs logged here:

1/22/2005 10:09:47 PM
Misha would like sort by ID or date.  I guess I can understand this, because there is an initial date in which a snippet is added to the KBase.  Sure you can't see it or touch it... well, it could show up in the header header.  Could be neat.




3/27/2005 3:36:45 PM
KBase should serialize its settings to an XML file.  If the XML file is not writable or readable, it should just go on.

10/23/2004 12:32:04 PM
- One of the nicest things I did yesterday was the highlighting.  Nice job!

10/24/2004 3:56:28 AM
Did a scalability test with a 45 meg file with 125K categories (50*50*50).
 - file://..%2fSample+KBases%2fa+lot+of+folders.zip 

10/22/2004 8:00:41 PM
- Adding IDs to the real objects and using those instead of hashes.  Maybe the IDs should be consistent between one save and the next?  Not sure but it seems right. (though this doesn't solve the problem of consistency among KBases, but whatever.) 
- Done 10/22/2004 8:58:54 PM

10/22/2004 8:59:41 PM
This is a great idea.  Why not have them all change colors when you select them?  That's fine, I'll do that.

10/25/2004 12:36:08 AM
- Fix unhighlighting, right now it has some problems.

10/25/2004 12:48:39 AM
- Now icons are always found if they're where the application is.

10/25/2004 12:36:50 AM
- MainForm should not store the original path but rather the actual path with which we manage to open the file.  Also, how does it handle it if it can't open a file at all?
- Still kind of fucked up, actually, but it's okay.  Right now if the file is not right, but there is already a file loaded, it doesn't leave the file alone.  

10/23/2004 12:27:46 PM
- Insert File Link blows up when the clipboard is empty.  Fix that.  
	- 10/23/2004 7:03:24 PM - I think this is fixed. Confirm that?
- While you're at it, fix the urls.  The substitution of %20s is only half the story.
	- 10/23/2004 7:17:09 PM - Okay, that's fixed.  Is it true that the System.Web assembly comes with the redistributable and therefore doesn't need to included as a file? 
- Also, Clipboard clears on Insert Date.  Why doesn't it get restored?  I think this is fixed, was a nulls problem?

10/25/2004 1:03:45 AM
- The DetailPane serialization sucks, actually.  I mean, it seems okay but it's not.  Maybe there's some way to do it without repainting, oh yeah, you can suspend updating, that would be cool.
- Also use StringBuffers for everything.10/25/2004 1:03:45 AM
- 10/25/2004 6:07:07 PM Did all that, and the other thing (which took 2 minutes) is to cache the RTF text in the Snippets so as not to recreate it all the time.  It would be more efficient to be able to build RTF from the snippets without using the pane, but whatever.  I mean, it's ugly now but it's fast if you don't change the sniippet.  Wow, it even works for my schizo saving habits!

Status: Assigned to drosenstark 12/18/2004

Seems like this is consistent with Windows Explorer.  To change the name you do a second click on the name that is NOT part of the double click.

DR: This must be fixed first.
1/22/2005 11:24:07 PM -- FIXED, actually it took like 1/2 an hour.  It was an Exception being thrown in the new fancy scroller thinger.



1/22/2005 10:14:12 PM
if your search produces 0 results, it still creates a snippet... this may be unavoidable, since otherwise you would have to create a custom pop up just to show there were no results, but it is kinda funny :)

I know this is going to sound strange
but I just thought about an amazing functionality addition:

how about being able to assign different (colors of) icons to a select (obviously, mutually exclusive) list of properties

in my example, I can say:
show all "source" snippet icons RED, all category snippets YELLOW, and all 'regular' snippets BLUE

this would really help in figuring out stuff in the left pane, and, for the future broader user base, would resemble (with an obvious improvement in functionality) the windows explorer interface

3) one topic we have not discussed so far: the search box.  How difficult would it be to implement a) more elaborate Boolean search (e.g with AndNot, etc.), b) an open box rather than drop-down boxes with standard conventions (e.g. quotation marks, wildcards)

When selection moves for a multiple select, the moved nodes don't get reselected correctly.

Now that's true for the single snippets too.

copying the same snippet twice under the same parent should be prevented (pop-up warning)

2005-04-11 14:40 PM
You MIGHT be able to do this by overriding equals so that nodes just check if they have the same snippet.  That might work, although it would probably make copying the node difficult.

You can definitely do this by change the addition of a child and just rejecting it.  Though right now we do that directly by modifying the Nodes collection.  Fuck.

which reminds me: partial export (of selected snippets only) is a must. 
Hope it would be an easy addition.  later we can think about various types of export, like top level only, or left pane only :)

2005-04-13 04:57 AM
This will not be implemented, but I will implement an export without save.

2005-04-18 11:27 AM
Okay working on this.  I need a 

IxpathPathNavigable for input, looks like XmlDocument already implements this IFC.  Yes, through XMLNode
an XmlWriter for output

my god how do you do a piped stream in .net?  Or is the whole deal that there are only streams and no difference between input and output?  Yeah, it's true, from a StreamWriter you can get the BaseStream... really, though I don't want to even create the doc in memory, but I guess that's inevitable.

Must get the sorting under control.

10/21/2004 7:59:37 PM
- Okay just inserted sorting.  I wanted it to be automatic, but it's hard to trap the event and not fuck with it.
- I COULD do something pretty easy and show the other parents by highlighting them in like red.  Not sure what the point is yet.
- 10/22/2004 11:27:00 PM 
- That's done, the highlighting thing that is


- Must remember the dream of the thing: be able to see Snippets that are in this category AND that category.  It should in fact be able to product that as another category called SEARCH RESULTS.

- Note that there must be and Edit Find, too.

- Last night I did a bunch of stuff with Searching.  Most of the underpinnings for a boolean search for parents.  Must expand out to include:
	- IS or contains
	- OR and AND are already there, NOT is *not* one of the conditions for that.

10/21/2004 5:19:31 PM
Go: 3:45pm

Stop: 4:07 That sucks.  The whole thing flashes, hard to control  Realized that pasting is fucked up with the bullets.  Must not just be a toggle, must be able to insist.

On the other hand, let's try another experiment.  What if we just get rid of all the fancy cutting and pasting altogether?

Go: 4:13 pm.
Done: 4:25, looks nice!  Must adjust it so that the formatting is always the same as the base font.  Can I do that?

5:13pm, Okay, got sidetracked, included zooming.  Was that in the feature list?  What feature list.

5:19pm, Wow just put in Date insertion.  Nice, okay, must sleep.  Why is the window always centered in the wrong place.</Text>

      <Text>The problem is that right now it's kind of a funky and totally non-standard concept that I'm using for cut and paste.  And even for serializing.

The main problem was that RTF is total crap.  My simple text format no está mal.  But then again, it's not as standard as HTML.  Really, I'm not sure about all of this yet.  But I think that my crazy format is probably not the best idea, not to mention the total chapuza sobre como lo he hecho
